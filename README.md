# 🎮 Simon Says Game

A fun and challenging memory-based game inspired by the classic *Simon Says*!  
Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this game sharpens your memory as the sequence gets longer at each level.  
**Track your highest score** — thanks to `localStorage` — and challenge yourself to beat it every time!
